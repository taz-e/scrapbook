== Welcome to Scrapbook

Scrapbook is a Rails application which allows you to store your photos in
various user defined albums. User can Login/Register on the website and can
create his/her Albums and then can add photos in it and can add tags on the
added photos.

The Main Functionality in this application is to create Album, its photos and
thier tags using nested forms and accepts_nested_attributes_for. The Various
Gems/Plugins used by me in this application are:

[x] pg
[x] bcrypt-ruby
[x] simple_form
[x] paperclip
[x] kaminari
[x] twitter-bootstrap-rails
[x] best_in_place

[x] bootstrap-filestyle
[x] slimbox2

The above 7 are ruby gems and the last two are jquery plugins. You can check
